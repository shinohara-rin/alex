# Alex - a more realistic(hopefully) chatbot poc

Fully vibed demo of a simple trick to make conversation feel more natural. Expect the code to be shitty, somehow it just works (or at least it does for me).

## How to run

- Provide an API key for Gemini in the .env file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`. You can get a free one from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Run the server: `python main.py`
- Run the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
